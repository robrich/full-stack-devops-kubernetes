Full-Stack DevOps: Containerize and Deploy to Kubernetes
========================================================

This is a live demo of building a DevOps pipeline to deploy containers to Kubernetes.

This app includes a React frontend app and a .NET backend API.

We start from an empty repository, scaffold an app using Aspire, live-code Dockerfile and .dockerignore for each project, live-code a Kubernetes YAML file, and push it up to GitHub. Then we live-code a GitHub Actions build that deploys both containers to Kubernetes.
